## Feedback tracker

Nottinghamshire Healthcare collects patient experience data in a number of different ways across many sites. It is necessary for staff to consider the amount of feedback being collected from each method across each of its clinical areas and at different levels of the three level service hierarchy. In the past this has been achieved using a report which is now very long and complex. This application will provide all of the relevant feedback numbers from each mode of response and at each clinical area and allow members of staff to look at the particular results that are of interest to them. 
In particular, the application will offer summaries:

* Over week/ month/ quarter
* In tabular and graph form
* At team/ directorate/ division/ trust level
* Across all modes- SMS, paper, online, etc.
